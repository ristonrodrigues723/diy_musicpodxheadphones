dtae day 7/7/25
tasks- nspeant a wek finding out the necesary components only fotr the selkles to stop selling them the country is shit basic compinents cant be found,
i recomp[ileed the entire bom this wont be a single mp3 ipod like devkice but combo of ipod/mp3 and dit headphones vreting headphones an ipod is easy getting parts in india is shit 
 tasks done today find replacements fir vendors , reserch , itrate imporve.
 man most good parts arent available in india ordering form cina sucksbigtime due to customs i personally called 3-4 vemnmdos but most refused intlkl cards this pushes up the budget not a single ve\ndor has most parts mos have 2-3 so it adds upo the cost for dilevery without thise parts nothing would be good. i crerated and revised the bom it should work for now atleast

- started with scheatic i cant not add the boster module itll make tyhe ipos more cluncky no more compact but tgia wont work without it![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/358be03c-0a3a-4001-9e0a-3aef4d634857)
